# Business-analytics-project
Project assesment:

1. Build a conversion funnel

The executive team is interested in understanding how well the website is converting product page views into purchases. Your first job is to create a conversion funnel to better understand how users interact with the website.

2. Prepare data for cohort analysis

The company wants you to build acquisition cohorts based on the month of a userâ€™s first purchase, and they want you to track cohort metrics month by month.

The largest part of this project is data preparation for cohort analysis. Get ready to practice some advanced spreadsheet techniques!

3. Calculated retention rate

The last steps of the analysis are to aggregate the purchase data into cohorts and then calculate retention rates for each cohort month by month.

Here are results:
